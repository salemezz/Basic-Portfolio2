To Whom it Concerns,
	I have helped aggregate, monitor, and frame all sorts of data in both the science and arts worlds. My background is in both horticulture and communications. I offer branding and marketing experience toward collaborative efforts for a variety of endeavors. Trends are not foreign to me, even on the web. During my studies I ran a small marketing firm for creatives and small business owners called Trickle Media with a few other multimedia artists. Iâ€™ve used Word Press, the Adobe Creative Suite and various other digital workstations for more than five years. My multimedia expertise definitely solidified while recently attending the UNC Coding Boot Camp. My computer hardware and electrical knowledge comes from automating and repairing horticultural systems both at home and in a professional setting. Which bred a basic understanding of both networking and hardware programming.

Sincerely,
Salem Ezz
